# ðŸ§± Mario â€“ CS50x Problem Set 6 (Less Comfortable)

This program prints a right-aligned half-pyramid of height between 1 and 8, using `#` characters.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Asks the user for a height between 1 and 8
- Uses nested `for` loops to print spaces and hashes accordingly

## ðŸš€ Run It

```bash
python mario.py
```

### Example:

```
Height: 4
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- `while` loop for validation
- Nested `for` loops
- `print(..., end="")` for same-line printing
