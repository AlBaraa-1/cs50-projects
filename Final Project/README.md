# Face Recognition 1.0
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/QeaujLacIAE>
#### Description:
Face Recognition 1.0 is a real-time face detection and identification system developed using Python. The project uses the `face_recognition` library to recognize and match faces, and OpenCV to handle video capture and display.

**Features:**
- **Real-Time Face Detection:** The system processes live video feeds to detect faces.
- **Face Recognition:** Identifies known faces by comparing them to a database of pre-loaded images.
- **Visual Feedback:** Recognized faces are highlighted with a green box and their names are displayed, while unrecognized faces are marked with a red box and labeled as 'Unknown'.

**Project Files:**

- **`main.py`:** The main script for the project.
  - **`load_images_from_folder(folder_path)`:** Loads images from the specified folder and extracts their filenames as labels.
  - **`find_encodings(images)`:** Converts images to RGB and generates face encodings for each image.
  - **`main()`:** Main function that sets up the video capture, processes frames, detects faces, and performs recognition. It draws rectangles around recognized faces in green and unrecognized faces in red.

- **`requirements.txt`:** Lists the required Python packages:
  - `opencv-python` for video capture and image processing.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `face_recognition` for face detection and recognition.

**Design Choices:**
- **Face Recognition Library:** The `face_recognition` library was chosen for its effectiveness in face detection and recognition with a simple API(Application Programming Interface) for encoding and comparing faces.
- **OpenCV:** Used for its capabilities in handling video feeds and displaying the results efficiently.
- **Visual Feedback:** Green rectangles are used for recognized faces to clearly indicate a match, while red rectangles highlight unrecognized faces to provide immediate visual feedback.

**Installation and Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Prepare a folder named `faces` with images of known faces for the system to recognize.
4. Run the main script with:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
5. The program will open a window displaying the video feed with face recognition results.

**Warnings and Notes:**
- Ensure that your webcam is connected and functioning properly before running the script.
- The script captures video from webcam index 2; you may need to adjust this if you have multiple webcams or if the default index does not work.
